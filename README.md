# Stock-Price-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
## Overview
Stock Market Price Prediction using Machine Learning is a project that leverages predictive modeling techniques to forecast stock prices based on historical data. The project employs various machine learning algorithms to analyze stock trends and make informed predictions.

## Features
- Data collection from various sources (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.)
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, feature engineering)
- Machine learning model selection (Linear Regression, LSTM )
- Model training and evaluation using performance metrics
- Visualization of stock trends and predictions
- User interface for easy interaction (Optional: Web or Desktop App)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models (LSTM, RNN)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Vruthvik48/stock-market-prediction.git
   cd stock-market-prediction
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Dataset
The project uses stock market data, which can be obtained from:
- Yahoo Finance
- Kaggle datasets

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R²)

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate sentiment analysis from financial news
- Implement reinforcement learning for trading strategies
- Improve feature selection techniques
- Enhance UI for better user experience
